project 4 
introducing Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)
First task : Creating a security group to access your EFS file system
1 - write in the search VPC then choose ( your VPCs ) then Create VPC and I think that project 3 steps will help you to create new VPC 
3 - after creating the Security group choose it and take Security group ID as a copy and write it in text editor as we will use it later 	
4 - let's create other security group 
Security group name : EFS Mount Target 
Description : Inbound NFS access from EFS clients 
VPC : the VPC you have created 
5 -  in Inbound rules choose add rule 
Type : NFS 
Source : write the Security group ID you have pasted in the text editor 

Task 2 : let's create EFS file system 
6 - in the search write EFS then choose Create file System 
7 - choose customize 
8 - clear the option of Enable automatic backups 
9 - in Lifecycle management , in Transition into infrequent access AI  select none 
10 - in Tags Optional 
Key : NAME
Value : My First EFS File System
Choose Next 
11 - For VPC : choose the VPC you have created 
12 - in the security group  remove the chosen options (default) and choose EFSClient 
then choose next then next again then create 
13 - Let's create EC2 instance 
write in the search EC2 then launch instance 
Name : EFS Client
app and OS image : Amazon Linux AWS 2023 kernel-6.1 AMI 
Instance type : t3.micro 
Key pair (login) choose Create new kay pair 
Kay pair name : Vockey 
Key pair type : RSA then .Pem then Create key pair then choose it
network setting choose edit
VPC : the vpc you have created 
Subnet : public Subnet you have created 
Auto-assign public IP : enable 
Security group : Select existing security group and choose only EFSClient 
14 - launch instance 
15 - choose the instance then choose connect then choose Session Manager then connect 

Task 3 : Creating a new directory and mounting the EFS file system
16 - write 
sudo su -l ec2-user
sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
sudo mkdir efs
17 - don't close this page and search in the console about EFS and choose My First EFS File System  then choose Attach to open the Amazon EC2 mount instructions 
you will find a point called Using the NFS client so take a copy of the written command  and it will be look like (sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-0fd1858bf045e6358.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ efs)
then come back to the Session manager and run that command and wait until it finishes 
17 - to know the full summary of available and used disk space usage write  
sudo df -hT

Final task ( TASK 4 ) : How to know the performance behavior of your new EFS file system ?
18 - to know the performance , use Flexible IO in the CLI 
Flex IO : is a synthetic I/O benchmarking utility for Linux. It is used to benchmark and test Linux I/O subsystems
write this command in the CLI but wait few minutes 
sudo fio --name=fio-efs --filesize=10G --filename=./efs/fio-efs-test.img --bs=1M --nrfiles=1 --direct=1 --sync=0 --rw=write --iodepth=200 --ioengine=libaio
when it finishes you will see something like that 
 

19 - I wish if I give you perfect info today 
20 - goodbye and see you soon in other project
